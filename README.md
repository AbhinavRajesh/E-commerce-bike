# An E-commerce Website Using ReactJS Framework

This project is a recreation of the website JensonUSA (www.jensonusa.com) with more focus on Mountain, BMX and Electric Bikes.

When deciding on how to build this site I wanted to take the advantage of many benefits a component based JavaScript Framework makes available to developers and users.
